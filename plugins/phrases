Scarecrow in the hillock\n Paddy field --\n How unaware!  How useful!\n

Passing through the world\n Indeed this is just\n Sogi's rain shelter.\n

A wild sea-\n In the distance over Sado\n The Milky Way.\n

The she cat - \n Grown thin\n From love and barley.\n

How wild the sea is,  \n and over Sado Island,  \n the River of Heaven\n

Morning and evening\n Someone waits at Matsushima!\n One-sided love.\n

Wrapping dumplings in  \n bamboo leaves, with one finger  \n she tidies her hair \n

On Buddha's birthday  \n a spotted fawn is born –\n just like that \n

On Buddha's deathday,  \n wrinkled tough old hands pray –  \n the prayer beads' sound \n

I like to wash,\n the dust of this world\n In the droplets of dew.\n

With dewdrops dripping,  \n I wish somehow I could wash  \n this perishing world \n

Won't you come and see\n loneliness? Just one leaf\n from the kiri tree.\n

moonless night...\na powerful wind embraces\nthe ancient cedars\n

Behind Ise Shrine,  \n unseen, hidden by the fence,  \n Buddha enters nirvana \n

This ruined temple  \n should have its sad tale told only  \n by a clam digger \n

in my new clothing\n i feel so different, i must\n look like someone else\n

low tide morning...\n the willow skirts are tailed\n in stinking mud\n

A green willow, \n dripping down into the mud, \n at low tide.  \n

a clear waterfall —\n into the ripples\n fall green pine-needles\n

overhanging pine...\n adding its mite of needles\n to the waterfall\n

The pine tree of Shiogoshi\n Trickles all night long\n Shiny drops of moonlight.\n

Culture's beginnings:  \n rice-planting songs from the heart  \n of the country \n

Singing, planting rice,  \n village songs more lovely  \n than famous city poems \n

Spring air --\n Woven moon\n And plum scent.\n

Heated spring air\n In tiny waves of an inch or two -\n Above wintery grass.\n

Fresh spring!\n The world is only Nine days old - \n These fields and mountains!\n

Spring!\n A nameless hill\n in the haze.\n

it is spring!\n a hill without a name\n in thin haze\n

Oh, these spring days!\n A nameless little mountain,\n wrapped in morning haze!\n

Spring too, very soon!\n They are setting the scene for it --\n plum tree and moon.\n

From all directions\n Winds bring petals of cherry\n Into the grebe lake.\n

Under the image of Buddha\n All these spring flowers\n Seem a little tiresome.\n

The leafless cherry,\n Old as a toothless woman,\n Blooms in flowers,\n Mindful of its youth.\n

That great blue oak  \n indifferent to all blossoms  \n appears more noble\n

The oak tree stands\n noble on the hill even in\n cherry blossom time\n

Spring rain \n conveyed under the trees\n in drops.\n

Spring rain\n Leaking through the roof,\n Dripping from the wasps' nest.\n

In this warm spring rain, \n tiny leaves are sprouting \n from the eggplant seed\n

The sun's way:\n hollyhocks turn toward it\n through all the rains of May.\n

Spring departs.\n Birds cry\n Fishes' eyes are filled with tears\n

No blossoms and no moon,\n and he is drinking sake\n all alone!\n

Temple bells die out.\n The fragrant blossoms remain.\n A perfect evening!\n

A little girl under a peach tree,\n Whose blossoms fall into the entrails\n Of the earth.\n

By the old temple, \n peach blossoms; \n a man treading rice.\n

Unknown spring --\n Plum blossom\n Behind the mirror.\n

With plum blossom scent,  \n this sudden sun emerges  \n along a mountain trail \n

Very brief:\n Gleam of blossoms in the treetops\n On a moonlit night.\n

From among the peach-trees\n "Blooming everywhere," \n The first cherry blossoms.\n

A lovely spring night  \n suddenly vanished while we  \n viewed cherry blossoms\n

From every direction  \n cherry blossom petals blow  \n into Lake Biwa \n

Kannon's* tiled temple  \n roof floats far away in clouds  \n of cherry blossoms  \n (Bodhisattva of Compassion)\n

From all these trees –  \n in salads, soups, everywhere –  \n cherry blossoms fall \n

Cedar umbrellas, off  \n to Mount Yoshimo for  \n the cherry blossoms.\n

On a journey,\n Resting beneath the cherry blossoms,\n I feel myself to be in a Noh play.\n

in the blossoms’ shade\n as in the noh drama\n a traveller sleeps\n

Clouds of cherry blossoms!  \n Is that temple bell in Ueno  \n or Asakusa? \n

The temple bell stops.\n But the sound keeps coming\n out of the flowers.\n

all the more I wish to see\n in those blossoms at dawn\n the face of a god\n

Searching storehouse eaves,  \n rapt in plum blossom smells,  \n the mosquito hums \n

Bush clover in blossom waves\n Without spilling\n A drop of dew.\n

the moon still is\n though it seems far from home\n Suma in summer\n

Taking a nap,\n Feet planted\n Against a cool wall.\n

Melon \n In morning dew,\n mud-fresh.\n

Wet with morning dew  \n and splotched with mud, the melon  \n looks especially cool \n

The old pond: \n a frog jumps in,- \n the sound of water.\n

Frog pond -- \n A leaf falls in\n Without a sound\n

The old pond;\n the frog.\n Plop!\n

At the ancient pond  \n a frog plunges into  \n the sound of water \n

Summer moon -\n Clapping hands, \n I herald dawn.\n

Mogami River, yanking\n The burning sky\n Into the sea.\n

Yellow rose petals\n Thunder - \n A waterfall.\n

Cold white azalea - \n Lone nun\n Under thatched roof.\n

Three months after we saw\n Cherry blossoms together\n I came to see the glorious\n Twin trunks of the pine.\n

I felt quite at home,\n As if it were mine sleeping lazily\n In this house of fresh air.\n

June clouds,\n At ease on\n Arashiyama Peak.\n

Octopus traps -  \n summer’s moonspun dreams,  \n soon ended. \n

Summer in the world;\n floating on the waves \n of the lake.\n

in your summer-room...\n garden and mountain going too\n as we slowly walk\n

Ugoku ha mo\n Naku osoroshiki\n Natsu kodachi \n Even leaves don't move\n Awesome is the\n Summer grove\n

The summer's grass!\n all that's left\n of ancient warriors' dreams.\n

Summer grasses: \n all that remains of great soldiers’ \n imperial dreams\n

A thicket of summer grass\n Is all that remains\n Of the dreams of ancient warriors.\n

All the rains of June\n it brings together, and it is swift --\n the river Morgami.\n

Summer zashiki\n Make move and enter\n The mountain and the garden.\n

This hot day swept away  \n into the sea by the  \n Mogami River \n

A lightning gleam:\n into darkness travels\n a night heron's scream.\n

Along the roadside, \n blossoming wild roses \n in my horse’s mouth\n

The farmer's roadside  \n hedge provided lunch for  \n my tired horse\n

My horse \n Clip-clopping over the fields--Oh ho!\n I too am part of the picture!\n

All day in grey rain\n hollyhocks follow the sun's\n invisible road\n

An ivy spray\n Trained up over the wall\n And a few bamboos\n Inviting a tempest.\n

How many priests\n How many morning glories\n Have perished under the pine\n Eternal as law?\n

along the mountain road\n somehow it tugs at my heart—\n a wild violet\n

Traveling this high  \n mountain trail, delighted  \n by violets \n

looking carefully,\n a shepherds purse is blooming\n under the fence\n

petal by petal\n yellow mountain roses fall—\n sound of rapids\n

Petals of the mountain rose\n Fall now and then,\n To the sound of the waterfall?\n

The petals tremble \n on the yellow mountain rose –\n roar of the rapids\n

Long conversations  \n beside blooming irises –  \n joys of life on the road \n

The lilies!\n The stems, just as they are,\n the flowers, just as they are.\n

The bee emerging \n from deep within the peony \n departs reluctantly\n

Slender, so slender \n its stalk bends under dew -- \n little yellow flower\n

For those who proclaim \n they’ve grown weary of children, \n there are no flowers\n

Exhausted, I sought  \n a country inn, but found  \n wisteria in bloom \n

Morning glory trailing --\n All day the gate-\n bolt's fastened.\n

Breakfast enjoyed  \n in the fine company of  \n morning glories \n

The morning glories  \n bloom, securing the gate  \n in the old fence \n

bush-clover flowers —\n they sway but do not drop\n their beads of dew\n

Flower \n under harvest sun - stranger\n To bird, butterfly.\n

without turning\n into a butterfly, autumn deepens \n for the worm\n

Deep into autumn\n and this caterpillar\n still not a butterfly\n

A caterpillar\n this deep in fall\n still not a butterfly\n

With every gust of wind, \n the butterfly changes its place \n on the willow.\n

On the white poppy, \n a butterfly’s torn wing \n is a keepsake\n

butterflies flit…\n that is all, amid the field\n of sunlight\n

butterflies flit\n in a field of sunlight\n that is all\n

Kochira muke\n Ware mo sabishiki\n Aki no kure\n Will you turn toward me?\n I am lonely too,\n This autumn evening.\n

As firmly cemented clam-shells\n Fall apart in autumn,\n So I must take to the road again,\n Farewell, my friends.\n

Farewell, my old fan.\n Having scribbled on it,\n What could I do but tear it\n At the end of summer?\n

kono aki wa nande\n toshiyoru kumo ni tori\n this autumn \n as-for why grow old \n cloud to bird\n

this autumn\n why am I aging so?\n to the clouds a bird\n

this autumn\n as reason for growing old\n a cloud and a bird\n

the whole family\n all with white hair and canes\n visiting graves\n

souls' festival\n today also there is smoke\n from the crematory\n

lotus pond\n as they are unplucked\n Souls' Festival\n

Buddha's Death Day \n from wrinkled praying hands \n the rosaries' sound\n

not to think of yourself\n as someone who did not count --\n Festival of the Souls\n

all night\n autumn winds being heard \n behind the mountains\n

so clear the sound\n echoes to the Big Dipper\n the fulling block\n

taken in my hand\n it will vanish in hot tears \n autumn frost\n

bright red\n the pitiless sun\n autumn winds\n

autumn wind\n broken with sadness\n his mulberry stick\n

autumn winds\n in the sliding door's opening \n a sharp voice\n

autumn wind:\n as thickets in fields are \n Fuwa's barriers\n

people no longer live\n at the Fuwa Barrier\n in a house with wooden eaves\n

weathered bones\n just thinking of the wind\n it pierces my body\n

in the world outside\n is it harvesting time?\n the grass of my hut\n

for one touched by monkey cries\n how is it when a child's abandoned\n in autumn winds\n

speaking out\n my lips are cold\n in autumn wind\n

autumn wind\n in Ise's shrine cemetery\n even more lonely\n

walking on and on \n even through I fall down sick\n in fields of clover\n

from this very day\n erase the inscription with dew\n on the bamboo hat\n

autumn colors\n without a pot\n of red-brown soup\n

turn this way!\n I too feel lonely\n late in autumn\n

Stone Mountain\n whiter than the stones \n autumn wind\n

borrowing sleep\n from the scarecrow's sleeves\n midnight frost\n

I would like to use  \n that scarecrow's tattered clothes  \n in this midnight frost \n

along this road\n going with no one\n autumn evening\n

autumn deepens\n the man next door\n how is he doing?\n

saying farewell to people\n farewell being said to me brings\n autumn in Kiso\n

I didn't die!\n the end of a journey\n is autumn nightfall\n

autumn nears\n my heart is drawn \n to a four-mat room\n

autumn night\n striking and making it crumble\n our small talk\n

blowing stones\n flying from the volcano Asama\n autumn gale\n

chrysanthemum's scent\n in the garden a worn-out sandal \n just the sole\n

rainy day\n the world's autumn closes\n Boundary Town\n

banana plant in autumn storm\n rain drips into tub\n hearing the night\n

departing autumn\n with hands spread open\n chestnut burs\n

Kiso's chestnuts\n for a person of the floating world\n a souvenir\n

Over the ruins of a shrine\n a chestnut tree\n still lifts its candles\n

I’ll take these back\n for the city slickers –\n sour chestnuts\n

The Chestnut by the eaves\n In magnificent bloom\n Passes unnoticed\n By men of this world.\n

though autumn winds blow\n it is still green\n bur of the chestnut\n

The winds of fall\n are blowing, yet how green\n the chestnut burr.\n

also green\n it should remain a thing\n the pepper pod\n

at Nara\n the fragrance of chrysanthemums\n ancient Buddhas\n

drinking morning tea\n the monk is peaceful\n the chrysanthemum blooms\n

while growing thin\n
without a reason\n
the chrysanthemum bud\n

white chrysanthemum\n
catching in one's eye\n
nary a speck of dust\n

chrysanthemums\n
flowers blooming\n
in the stones\n

autumn coolness\n
hand and hand paring away\n
eggplants -- cucumbers\n

don't imitate me\n
we are not two halves\n
of a muskmelon\n

ear of the pine tree\n
mushroom on a strange tree\n
with a leaf stuck to it\n

the village so old\n
there's not a single house \n
without a persimmon tree\n

autumn begins\n
sea and sprouting rice fields\n
one green\n

failing health\n
chewing dried seaweed\n
my teeth grate on sand\n

grabbing at straws\n
the strength to bear\n
our parting\n

on this mountain\n
tell me of its sorrow\n
wild-yam digger\n

after the flowers\n
all there is left for my haiku\n
wisteria beans\n

The beginning of autumn;\n
The sea and fields,\n
All one same green.\n

In the bitter radish that\n
bites into me, I feel the\n
autumn wind\n

Will you turn toward me?\n
I am lonely, too,\n
this autumn evening.\n

Cho tori-no\n
Shiranu hana ari\n
Aki no sora\n
Unknown to birds and butterflies\n
A flower blooms\n
The autumn sky\n

a strange flower \n
for birds and butterflies\n
the autumn sky\n

Autumn approaches  \n
and the heart begins to dream  \n
of four-tatami rooms \n

Wild boars and all\n
are blown along with it --\n
storm-wind of fall!\n

A autumn wind\n
More white\n
Than the rocks in the rocky mountain.\n

kono michi ya yuku hito nashi ni aki no kure\n
this road go \n
person nonexistent \n
with autumn’s evening\n

On this road \n
where nobody else travels\n
autumn nightfall\n

All along this road  \n
not a single soul – only  \n
autumn evening comes \n

Along this way,\n
no travellers.\n
Dusk in autumn.\n

My way –\n
no-one on the road\n
and it’s autumn, getting dark\n

The first day of the year:\n
thoughts come - and there is loneliness;\n
the autumn dusk is here.\n

Cold as it was\n
We felt secure sleeping together\n
In the same room.\n

Chilling autumn rains  \n
curtain Mount Fuji, then make it  \n
more beautiful to see \n

The winter storm\n
Hid in the bamboo grove\n
And quieted away.\n

Should I hold them in my hand,\n
They will disappear\n
In the warmth of my tears,\n
Icy strings of frost.\n

Hailstones\n
Glancing off the rocks\n
At Stony Pass.\n

Awake at night,\n
The lamp low,\n
The oil freezing.\n

Winter rain --\n
The field stubble\n
Has blackened.\n

Crossing long fields, \n
frozen in its saddle, \n
my shadow creeps by\n

Awakened at midnight  \n
by the sound of the water jar  \n
cracking from the ice \n

Water-drawing rites,  \n
icy sound of monks' getas  \n
echo long and cold \n

On the cow shed\n
A hard winter rain; \n
Cock crowing.\n

The winter leeks\n
Have been washed white --\n
How cold it is!\n

Winter downpour -  \n
even the monkey  \n
needs a raincoat. \n

Winter solitude--\n
in a world of one color\n
the sound of wind.\n

I'm a wanderer  \n
so let that be my name –  \n
the first winter rain \n

Winter seclusion –  \n
sitting propped against  \n
the same worn post \n

On New Year's Day  \n
each thought a loneliness \n
as winter dusk descends \n

Along my journey  \n
through this transitory world,  \n
new year's housecleaning \n

Year’s end, all  \n
corners of this  \n
floating world, swept.\n

This first fallen snow  \n
is barely enough to bend  \n
the jonquil leaves \n

The first snow\n
the leaves of the daffodil\n
bending together\n

The first snow,\n
Just enough to bend\n
The leaves of the daffodils.\n

Tethered horse;\n
snow\n
in both stirrups.\n

First snow\n
Falling\n
On the half-finished bridge.\n

On the polished surface\n
Of the divine glass,\n
Chaste with flowers of snow.\n

The crescent lights\n
The misty ground.\n
Buckwheat flowers.\n

Come out to view  \n
the truth of flowers blooming  \n
in poverty \n

New Year’s first snow -- ah -- \n
just barely enough to tilt \n
the daffodil\n

Polished and polished \n
clean, in the holy mirror  \n
snow flowers bloom \n

Watching for snow,\n
the boozers’ faces –\n
a flash of lightning\n

fragrant orchid—\n
into a butterfly’s wings\n
it breathes incense\n

Wake, butterfly -\n
It's late, we've miles\n
To go together.\n

Butterfly -\n
Wings curve into\n
White poppy.\n

Heard, not seen,  \n
the camellia poured rainwater  \n
when it leaned \n

Misty rain;\n
Today is a happy day,\n
Although Mt. Fuji is unseen.\n

Even a wild boar\n
With all other things\n
Blew in this storm.\n

The wind from Mt. Fuji\n
I put it on the fan.\n
Here, the souvenir from Edo.\n

Tremble, oh my gravemound,  \n
in time my cries will be  \n
only this autumn wind \n

shaking the grave\n
my weeping voice\n
autumn wind\n

Sleep on horseback,\n
The far moon in a continuing dream,\n
Steam of roasting tea.\n

where's the moon?\n
as the temple bell is --\n
sunk in the sea\n

The moon about to appear,\n
all present tonight\n
with their hands on their knees.\n

Black Cloudbank broken\n
Scatters in the night...Now see\n
Moon-lighted mountains!\n

Husking rice,  \n
a child squints up  \n
to view the moon. \n

a peasant’s child\n
husking rice, pauses\n
to look at the moon\n

The clouds come and go,  \n
providing a rest for all  \n
the moon viewers \n

Clouds come from time to time --\n
and bring to men a chance to rest\n
from looking at the moon.\n

All the fields hands  \n
enjoy a noontime nap after  \n
the harvest moon\n

Whore and monk, we sleep  \n
under one roof together,  \n
moon in a field of clover \n

Now I see her face,  \n
the old woman, abandoned,  \n
the moon her only companion \n

A cuckoo cries,  \n
and through a thicket of bamboo  \n
the late moon shines \n

This bright harvest moon  \n
keeps me walking all night long  \n
around the little pond \n

the moon:\n
I wandered around the pond\n
all night long\n

the setting moon\n
the thing that remains\n
four corners of his desk\n

In the moonlight a worm\n
silently\n
drills through a chestnut\n

All my friends\n
viewing the moon –\n
an ugly bunch\n

Among moon gazers  \n
at the ancient temple grounds  \n
not one beautiful face \n

viewing the moon\n
no one at the party\n
has such a beautiful face\n

The moon is the guide,\n
Come this way to my house,\n
So says the host of a wayside inn.\n

occasional clouds\n
one gets a rest\n
from moon-viewing\n

hair shaved in a moon-shape\n
with their hands on their knees\n
in the early hours of night\n

buying a measure box\n
now I feel differently\n
about moon-viewing\n

sleeping in the temple\n
the serious-looking face\n
is moon-viewing\n

the full moon \n
seven story-songs of a woman\n
turning towards the sea\n

the farmer's child \n
rests from husking rice\n
then sees the moon\n

famous moon!\n
circling the pond all night\n
even to the end\n

the moon so pure\n
a wandering monk carries it\n
across the sand\n

harvest moon\n
northland weather\n
uncertain skies\n

full autumn moon\n
to my gate comes rising\n
crested tide\n

thin from the Kiso trip\n
and still not yet recovered\n
the late harvest moon\n

blue seas\n
breaking waves smell of rice wine \n
tonight's moon\n

Autumn full moon,  \n
the tides slosh and foam  \n
coming in\n

Mii Temple\n
knocking on the gate for a wish\n
today's moon\n

your hermitage\n
the moon and chrysanthemums \n
plus an acre of rice fields\n

flower of the harvest moon?\n
it only looks that way\n
a cotton field\n

butt of the tree\n
see in the cut end\n
today's moon\n

on a bare branch\n
a crow has settled\n
autumn dusk\n

A solitary  \n
crow on a bare branch-  \n
autumn evening \n

Kareeda ni\n
karasu no tomari keri\n
aki no kure\n
On dead branches \n
Crows remain perched\n
At autumn's end.\n

The voices of plovers\n
Invite me to stare into the darkness\n
Of the Starlit Promontory.\n

Dark night - \n
Plover crying \n
For its nest.\n

Sparrow, spare\n
The horsefly\n
Dallying in flowers.\n

in blossoms\n
a horsefly plays… don’t eat it\n
friend-sparrow\n

Sparrows \n
In rape-field,\n
Blossom-viewing.\n

Sparrows in eves\n
Mice in ceiling -\n
Celestial music.\n

Baby mice in their nest \n
squeak in response \n
to the young sparrows\n

Where cuckoo\n
Vanishes - \n
An island.\n

higher than a skylark\n
resting in the sky \n
on a mountain pass\n

above the moor\n
not attached to anything\n
a skylark singing\n

though a skylark sings\n
beating inside\n
the pheasant's sad cry\n

All the day long- \n
yet not long enough for the skylark,\n
singing, singing.\n

Do the tea-pickers also,\n
hidden in the bushes,\n
hear the hototogishu?\n

Skylark on moor --\n
Sweet song\n
Of non-attachment.\n

Over skylark's song\n
Noh cry \n
Of Pheasant\n

resting higher\n
than a lark in the sky\n
a mountain pass\n

Even these long days  \n
are not nearly long enough  \n
for the skylarks to sing \n

By a singular stroke\n
Of luck, I saw a solitary hawk circling\n
Above the promontory of Irago.\n

Unknowingly he guided us\n
over pathless hills\n
with wisps of hay\n

My eyes following\n
until the bird was lost at sea\n
found a small island\n

A mountain pheasant cry \n
fills me with fond longing for \n
father and mother\n

The lightning flashes\n
And slashing through the darkness,\n
A night-heron’s screech.\n

O bush warblers! \n
Now you’ve shit all over \n
my rice cake on the porch\n

the sea darkens —\n
the voices of the wild ducks\n
are faintly white\n

Seas slowly darken  \n
and the wild duck's plaintive cry  \n
grows faintly white \n

very exciting\n
yet after awhile so sad\n
cormorant fishing\n

a sick wild duck\n
falling down with the dark cold\n
to sleep overnight\n

cloud-parting friend!\n
temporarily this wild goose\n
must go away\n

With a warbler for  \n
a soul, it sleeps peacefully,  \n
this mountain willow\n

The warbler sings  \n
among new shoots of bamboo  \n
of coming old age \n

Delight, then sorrow,  \n
aboard the cormorant  \n
fishing boat \n

But for a woodpecker  \n
tapping at a post, no sound  \n
at all in the house \n

Even in Kyoto,  \n
how I long for Kyoto  \n
when the cuckoo sings \n

Lead my pony  \n
across this wide moor to where  \n
the cuckoo sings \n

The shallows –\n
a crane’s thighs splashed\n
in cool waves\n

A dragonfly, trying to –\n
oops, hang on to the upside\n
of a blade of grass\n

temple bell\n
also sounds like it is\n
cicada's voice\n

cricket \n
forgetting sounds with its cry\n
by the fireplace\n

in the cow shed\n
mosquito's voice darkens \n
lingering heat\n

bagworm's place\n
it seems to be inside\n
the cherry blossoms\n

bagworms \n
to hear their songs\n
come to my hut\n

spiders have a cry?\n
well, what is chirping\n
autumn's wind?\n

secretly at night\n
a worm under the moon\n
bores into a chestnut\n

With what kind of voice\n
would the spider cry\n
in the autumn wind?\n

Firefly viewing -\n
Drunken steersman,\n
Drunken boat.\n

The dragonfly\n
Can't quite land\n
On that blade of grass.\n

Dying cricket,\n
how he sings out\n
his life!\n

Gray hairs being plucked,  \n
and from below my pillow  \n
a cricket singing \n

Ungraciously, under  \n
a great soldier's empty helmet,  \n
a cricket sings \n

how piteous!\n
beneath the soldiers helmet\n
chirps a cricket\n

a terrible sound –\n
the gilded helmet’s \n
trapped cricket\n

Yagate shinu\n
Keshiki wa miezu\n
Semi no koe\n
Cicadas singing --\n
No sign\n
Of dying soon.\n

soon to die\n
yet no sign of it\n
in the cidada's chirpNothing in the cry \n
of cicadas suggests they \n
are about to die\n

Shizukasa ya\n
Iwa ni shimi-iru\n
Semi no koe\n
Calm and serene\n
The sound of a cicada\n
Penetrates the rock\n

stillness\n
piercing the rocks\n
cicada's shrill\n

Lonely silence,  \n
a single cicada's cry  \n
sinking into stone \n

How still it is!\n
Stinking into the stones,\n
the locusts' trill.\n

Eaten alive by \n
lice and fleas -- now the horse \n
beside my pillow pees\n

at my poor hovel\n
there’s one thing I can offer —\n
small mosquitoes\n

The usually hateful crow:\n
he, too -- this morning,\n
on the snow!\n

Even that old horse \n
is something to see this \n
snow-covered morning\n

What luck!\n
The southern valley\n
Make snow fragrant.\n

Hello! Light the fire!\n
I'll bring inside \n
a lovely bright ball of snow\n

to Kyoto\n
still half the sky to go—\n
snowy clouds\n

Only half the way I came\n
To the ancient capital,\n
And above my head\n
Clouds heavy with snow.\n

Crossing half the sky,  \n
on my way to the capital,  \n
big clouds promise snow \n

Not even a hat --\n
and cold rain falling on me?\n
Tut-tut! Think of that!\n

A cold rain starting\n
And no hat --\n
So?\n

under my tree-roof\n
slanting lines of april rain\n
separate to drops\n

The banana tree  \n
blown by winds pours raindrops  \n
into the bucket \n

How admirable,\n
He who thinks not, "Life is fleeting,"\n
When he sees the lightning!\n

How very noble!  \n
One who finds no satori \n
in the lightning-flash \n

Shake, oh grave!\n
The autumn wind\n
Is the voice of my wailing.\n

Ill on a journey,\n all about the dreary fields\n fly my broken dreams.\n

Sick on my journey,\nonly my dreams will wander\nthese desolate moors

A weathered skeleton\nin windy fields of memory,\npiercing like a knife\n

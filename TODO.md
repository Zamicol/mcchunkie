Need to clean up command options.
 - probably move them to a repl for greater awesome.
   - repl should allow for connecting to various servers (irc and xmpp)
   - repl should allow sending messages to services (both?)

Make plugins service transparent
 - stuff that expects /^mcchunkie:/ doesn't really work well in xmpp

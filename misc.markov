Some time ago I played a bit with traffic shaping on this box, but
did not have the time to test it properly and left that disabled on

fine, I don't understant what is happening regarding queues
one for wifi net and one I called torrent net which, as you may expect,
Basically I want google hangouts traffic to be priorized as much as
The sum of all sub-queues when I try to saturate the uplink is greater
When I saturate the link with traffic going out on "q_pri", "q_dow" and
I need all the uplink to make a video-call, but I really want to
So, any good soul could waste some time trying to explain all this ?
